Title - Meeting Scheduler using Priority Queues

In this project "Meeting Scheduler using Priority Queues",we have created a program that can be used to store, modify,view, delete etc. information of meeting efficiently with Password protection.
Further, meeting can be viewed in order of its importance(priority).
Priority Queue has been implemented using heaps to store meeting in order of priority, so as to get better running time efficiency.

Program input and output  : 

First of all choose edit password option, and edit the password.(because initially there is no file "Password", it is important to do so)
When asked password while changing password(for the first time), simply press enter and set new password.
And use this "new password" further in program.(Note : you can again change password at any point of time)

After, setting (editing for first time) password, you can add meeting details. And see the list by choosing view meeting in order of priority or of a particular date and/or time.
Also, you can edit and/or delete any meeting at any point of time.


NOTE : whenever program is run, make sure to delete binary files in current directory because meeting details of previous running of program is stored in them.
Also, first step is to edit password(simply press enter button when asked password for the first time editing of password).
